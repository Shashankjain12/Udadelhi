**What's this Repository About?**

This Repository is an initiative to learn some of the trending concepts related to Machine Learning . This is the place where I will be posting study material related to the topics that we will be discussing related to machine learning.

**Some Of the major Topics Of Disccussion**

* Chatbots using RNN and LSTM
* GAN's And Neural Style Transfer Learning
* POSE estimation using OpenCv
* Meetups

**What's Your Responsibility**

Looking for some active participation from everyone. 
1. You guys can share any of the resources related study material related to the course.
2. Can push your work which you have done for the community.
3. Can also add daily progress which are doing in the secure and private AI group

**What I will be doing**

1. I will be posting the study material related to the course
2. I after reviewing the submission will be pushing to the github repository
3. Will be posting some course related items and will be pushing the code to the repository to code along with some of the crucial concepts related to machine learning

**Some of the MNIST GAN's Magic**
